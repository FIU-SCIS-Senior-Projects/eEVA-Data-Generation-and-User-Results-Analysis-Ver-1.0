# eEVA-Data-Generation-and-User-Results-Analysis-Ver-1.0 
eEVA Data Generation and User Results Analysis Ver 1.0 was developed in Fall 2016 by Carlos Mestre and Stephanie Lunn.

We worked to complete user stories related to the results of eEVA, as well as user stories necessary for the functioning of the overall system. There are 5 folders for eEVA Results ver 1.0, and the directory structure is as follows:

1. Code - All the code for this project
2. Documents - Project Documentation (Which contains the Final Project Documentation and the User Manual and Installation Guide in its Appendices), and the Meeting Minutes (Daily Scrum, Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective, and Sprint Review)
3. Posters- The posters for each student
4. Presentation Slides - The PowerPoint presentation for eEVA
5. Videos- Contains an index.html file with links to all 4 videos (an Introduction, Admin User Guide, Installation User Guide, and a Shortcomings/Wishlist)
