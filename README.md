# eEVA-Data-Generation-and-User-Results-Analysis-Ver-1.0 
eEVA Data Generation and User Results Analysis Ver 1.0 was developed in Fall 2016 by Carlos Mestre and Stephanie Lunn.

We worked to complete user stories related to the results of eEVA, as well as user stories necessary for the functioning of the overall system.
