eEVA Data Generation and User Results Analysis Ver 1.0 Code

Per the request of the product owner, the system code will not be given, nor will the database. This means that any functions added into the MVC system, will not be available, unless given permission from the product owner to download from the Affective Social Computing Laboratory's Repository. If granted permission, the instructions are available along with a complete installation guide in the Project Documentation Folder, inside the FinalProjectDocumentation.pdf file. However, many of the results page user stories required HTML code to be injected into web frameworks, using content elements in the survey editor. This code is available. To access the code create, go to the HTMLCode_ContentElements folder. Within this are two subfolders:

BAC: Pages for the Blood Alcohol Concentration Results. While Page BAC1 requires the counselor speak the content, the following pages are HTML coded- BAC2A, BAC2B, and BAC3
	-BAC2a: 			Your Blood Alcohol Concentration page, displays user's scores and a table with what the various BAC levels mean
	-BAC2b: 			Your Blood Alcohol Concentration page, displays user's scores and a checkbox for a user to select their reaction to their scores
	-BAC3: 				Your Blood Alcohol Concentration page, displays a table which highlights BAC for a user's typical night of drinking based on selected hours they drink and 
						the number of drinks they might have, also includes a print feature to print the table without the counselor

DC: Pages for the Drinking Consequences Results. DC1-5 all contain the HTML code for the pages to display the results on the following:
	-DC1: 				Quality of Drinking
	-DC2: 				Brief Drinker Profile (BDP) Feedback Summary, Risk for Future Alcohol-Related Problems
	-DC3a and 3b: 		Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC) Feedback Summary, Alcohol-Related Consequences, split into 2 pages for user readability
	-DC4:	 			Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-C) Feedback Summary, Dependence
